    "This assignment should be completed in Python, and an PDF file should be submitted, containing both code and written answers. If you like, you may create your own Jupyter Notebook file from scratch, but it is likely easier to modify this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please do not be intimidated by the apparent length of this assignment (it is deceiving!). All required code is a single line. Questions that require identification and/or intepretation will not penalized for brevity of response: if a question can be answered with 'yes/no', or a numeric value, you may simply state as much. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through comparable code and concepts in class. If you run into trouble, start by using the help `help()` function in Python, to get information about the datasets and function in question. The internet is also a great resource when coding (though note that no outside searches are required by the assignment!). If you do incorporate code from the internet, please cite the source within your code (providing a URL is sufficient).\n",
